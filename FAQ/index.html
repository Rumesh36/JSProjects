        <h3 class="">What is Javascript</h3>
        <button class="toggle"><i class="fa-solid fa-plus fa-lg"></i></button>
     </div>

        <div class="ans">JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It enables features like real-time updates, animations, form validation, and event handling, making websites more engaging and user-friendly. As a client-side language, JavaScript runs directly in web browsers, reducing the need for constant server communication. However, with the advent of Node.js, it is also widely used for server-side development. JavaScript supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming paradigms, making it highly versatile. It plays a crucial role in modern web development, often working alongside HTML and CSS to build responsive and interactive applications.</p>

            <b> Variables </b> 
            Variables store data and can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`. `let` and `const` are preferred in modern JavaScript due to their block scope and better security.  
            
            <b>Data Types </b>
            JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, null, and undefined. These types define the kind of data a variable can hold.  
            
            <b> Functions  </b>
            Functions help in reusing code and can be defined using traditional function declarations or modern arrow functions (`()=>{}`). They can take parameters and return values.  
            
            <b>Control Structures  </b>
            JavaScript provides decision-making structures like `if-else` and `switch` statements, along with loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to handle repetitive tasks efficiently.  
            
            <b> Events </b> 
            JavaScript follows an event-driven model, allowing interaction with users through events like clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements using event listeners.  
            
            <b> Asynchronous JavaScript</b>  
            JavaScript can handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await, which help in executing non-blocking tasks like API calls and timeouts.  
            
            These core concepts are essential for writing efficient and interactive JavaScript applications.</p>

        <div class="ans"><b>Features of JavaScript </b>  

            1. Lightweight and Fast – JavaScript is an interpreted language, making it quick to execute in web browsers without the need for compilation.  
            2. Cross-Platform Compatibility – It runs on all modern browsers and operating systems without requiring additional software.  
            3. Client-Side Execution – Reduces server load by running directly in the browser, leading to better performance.  
            4. Asynchronous Processing – JavaScript can handle multiple tasks simultaneously using callbacks, promises, and async/await.  
            5. Rich Libraries and Frameworks – Libraries like jQuery and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue enhance JavaScript’s capabilities.    
            
            <b>Applications of JavaScript </b> 
            
            1. Web Development – JavaScript is used to build interactive and dynamic websites.  
            2. Web Applications – Popular web apps like Gmail, Facebook, and Twitter rely on JavaScript frameworks.  
            3. Mobile App Development – Frameworks like React Native and Ionic enable JavaScript-based mobile applications.  
            4. Game Development – JavaScript is used for browser-based games with libraries like Phaser.js and Three.js.  
            5. Server-Side Development – With Node.js, JavaScript can handle backend tasks, databases, and APIs.  
            
            JavaScript’s flexibility and efficiency make it one of the most widely used programming languages today.</p>
